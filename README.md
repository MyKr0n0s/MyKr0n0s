# 👋 Hello, I'm Mickaël (aka @MyKr0n0s)

🎯 I'm currently Lead Developer in a tech startup, building scalable web applications and crafting custom solutions.

💻 Passionate about clean code, architecture, and developer experience, I spend most of my time working with:
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **React.js**, **Node.js**, **NestJS**
- **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**
- testing, and cloud-based deployment (Nginx, PM2, etc.)

🔐 I have a growing interest in **Web Security**, **Cybersecurity**, and **IoT**, which I regularly explore through personal projects and technical watch.

🤝 I enjoy contributing to internal tools and collaborative side-projects.
